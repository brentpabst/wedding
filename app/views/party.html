                            Dana and I met on my very first day of classes at Case Western and became fast friends. We took every music class together for 4 years, and she is on her way to finishing her PhD in Musicology. I was honored to be her maid of honor at her wedding in 2011. I couldn't imagine getting married without Dana standing beside me, returning the favor.

                            Another Case Western grad, I've spent more time living with Jocelyn than with anyone other than my parents. We were hallmates our freshmen year and suitemates the next 2. We first bonded over a love of music, she having played Viola and Violin for many years. After graduation, she moved to Raleigh to work for IBM and we lived together another 2 years. Strangely enough, the NY native is the only bridesmaid who currently lives in the state of NC.

                            Kendall is no obligatory "sister of the groom" bridesmaid. Since I started dating Brenton, we've spent a lot of time together, and I've discovered how awesome she is. We share the mutant gene that makes us want to get up in front of people to sing our faces off, even if it is in different styles. As an only child, I'm so excited to be gaining a sister!

                            I have to credit Katie for officially introducing me to Brenton, even if it was 7 years before we started dating. We met Freshmen year of High school and were in many plays together throughout high school (another thespian!). We kept in touch through college and after. The first date Brenton and I had that wasn't just the 2 of us was to her housewarming party, to everyone's surprise.

She is a strong, confident woman who taught shy middle school Alana to come out of her shell. I never know where she is (she travels so much for work and pleasure) but I know she'd be there for me in an instant if I needed.

We met in 5 year old church choir and never stopped singing together, including a rock Romeo & Juliet musical in 2005 (all my friends are so talented). We've had countless sleepovers and attended NC Governor's School together one summer. It's so amazing to have had a friend for almost my entire life.
